                <td><pre id="pre">A low power flip-flop is a time-consuming delay element in the DAC system's digital sigma delta
modulator. The focus of this study is on employing a variety of optimization strategies to reduce
the power consumption of a single-phase timed feedback D flip-flop. In this scenario, flip-flop 
no data transitions are avoided by building a single-phase timed inverter. Area, speed, and power 
are all trade-offs that can be made. This strategy relies on power optimization with favorable 
speed and area. Analysis is carried out in the MICROWIND simulator of the DSCH environment and ltspice. </pre></td>

smoke detecting sensors. It has pair of infrared sensors which are continuously moni-
toring the visibility in the premises where they are attached.In case a fire erupts,
smoke gets generated and spreads in and around the premises. Once this smoke reaches
the smoke detector module the visibility of the infrared sensors get obstructed. </pre></td>

the presence of an active cell phone in a radius of 1m-1.5m. As the cell phone 
sends or receives a message or call, it sends off a signal. This signal is detected 
by our circuit and will cause the LED to blink and buzzer to sound. This is the basic
principle of the project. This simple circuit can detect any cellphone activities like 
sending or receiving calls or SMS, or any type of data transmission. </pre></td>
